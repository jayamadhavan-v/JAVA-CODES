✅ What is a Class?

    A class is a blueprint or template. It defines how an object should look (properties) and behave (methods).

✅ What is an Object?

    An object is a real-world entity created from a class.

-->Example in real life:

Class: Car (blueprint)

Objects: BMW, Audi, Ferrari (real cars made from blueprint)

✅ Constructors in Java:
    A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects.
It runs automatically when an object is created.

✅ Types of Constructors

    Default Constructor – Provided by Java automatically

    No-arg Constructor – Created by programmer without parameters

    Parameterized Constructor – With parameters

✅ "this" Keyword in Java:
    -->The this keyword is a very important OOP concept in Java.
It refers to the current object.
    -->Here, both variables refer to the local parameters,
not class variables — so object variables remain null and 0.

✅ static Keyword in Java:
    static means “belongs to the class, not to an object.”
    That means all objects share the same static member.

⚠️ Important Rules

Static methods can’t access non-static variables directly
(because they belong to the class, not to an object)

You can call a static variable like
→ Student.collegeName

🧱  Encapsulation:

        Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods together
inside a class and restricting direct access to the data.
        private access and allow changes only through methods.
        -->It protects data from being set to invalid or harmful values.
        -->It controls access, so only trusted methods (with checks)
can modify it.

🧱  Inheritance in Java:
💡 Simple Definition:

Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class.
Think of it as “child class inherits from parent class.”

✅ super():
    super() always calls the parent class constructor first — that’s how inheritance
ensures the parent part of the object is built before the child part.

 🧩 Hierarchical Inheritance :
      When multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class,
 it’s called hierarchical inheritance.

 🧩 POLYMORPHISM
 💡 Simple meaning:

 “Poly” = many, “Morphism” = forms
 So Polymorphism means many forms.

        It allows the same method name or object reference
 to behave differently based on the object type.


1️⃣ Abstraction
    Abstraction is hiding the implementation details and
 showing only the functionality.

How in Java?
    Use abstract classes or interfaces
    Can have abstract methods (no body) that child classes must implement

✅ Key Point:
    You cannot create an object of abstract class Person.
    You can only create objects of concrete child classes.

2️⃣ Interface
        Interface defines a contract that implementing classes must follow.
